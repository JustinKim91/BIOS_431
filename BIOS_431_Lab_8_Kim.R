## Question 1 -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Our group predicted that the hosts would win, given that there would be a
# ... constant re-flux of random suits (genes) in the host population when a
# ... large portion of the population succumbs to the disease. In contrast,
# ... when a parasite survives, it more heavily invests in the surviving gene
# ... (1 card for host reproduction vs 2 cards for parasite reproduction).

## Question 2 -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Neither the host nor the parasite really "won" the game, as both populations
# ... persisted and went through upheavals of genetic composition.However, in
# ... a sense, we can argue that the host "won," given that the host population
# ... persisted despite the parasite induced deaths. This is determination of
# ... the winner is based on the perspective that the goal of the host is to
# ... survive while the goal of the parasite is to kill. 

## Question 3 -----------------------------------------------------------------

# This did not entirely meet our initial prediction that the host population
# ... would be victorious. Our prediction was that the higher reproductive 
# ... investment of parasites, in comparison to the hosts would cause an
# ... evolution of the host population to eradicate the parasites. However, we
# ... observed a back-and-forth shift of genotypes between the two populations.

## Question 4 -----------------------------------------------------------------

# For the hosts, the Red Queen Hypothesis prediction of genetic variation
# ... during host-parasite coevolution seemed to hold true for the most part.
# ... While there were simulation that ended up with a skew towards specific
# ... genotypes, there were definitely observable variations throughout the
# ... game for the host population.

# The same can be said for the parasite population. Both host and parasite
# ... populations experienced loss and maintenance of genetic variation. The
# ... genetic variation of either population heavily depended upon the
# ... host-parasite interactions during the game: natural selection
# ... (non-matching cards) caused decrease in variation in both populations as
# ... reproduction selected for the genotype that survived most. Mutations
# ... (selection of random cards to fill 12) created variation by adding new
# ... and random genotypes.

## Question 5 -----------------------------------------------------------------

# If there was an absence of parasites, I would predict that the genotype
# ... frequencies would remain some what stable. To test these conditions,
# ... I would simulate the game with the same rules, but just have no parasite
# ... population. Thus, every host would survive (not die of parasite related
# ... health complications). In this model, each surviving member would produce
# ... a single offspring of the same genotype, essentially doubling the
# ... population, but maintaining the genotype proportions before selection of 
# ... of the new generation. Under these circumstances, I would reason that the
# ... genetic composition of the host population would remain relatively stable

## Question 6 -----------------------------------------------------------------

# The oscillations for host and parasite genotypes are not perfectly synced.
# ... The host genotype oscillation generally lags behind that of the host
# ... population by about 1-2 generations. This is likely due to the parasite
# ... evolution in response to the host genotype frequencies. During the game,
# ... we noticed that, given a high frequency of a genotype in a host, the
# ... parasite had a strong chance of surviving a generation since there was a
# ... high likelihood of matching the parasite genotype to the high-frequency
# ... genotype of the host. In turn, the parasite reproduced heavily towards
# ... this specific genotype (2 cards) and began to increase in this genotype.
# ... This would then cause a decrease in the host genotype, as more matches
# ... showed up, and the cycle continued this way.Thus, both oscillations
# ... technically lag behind each other, but in the context of the game, I
# ... think that it would be more appropriate to detail the parasite population
# ... lagging behind the host.
